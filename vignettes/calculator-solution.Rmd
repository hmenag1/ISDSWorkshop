# Bayes Rule' - Solution

Calculate the probability the individual has the disease if the test is positive when

- the specificity of the test is 0.99, 
- the sensistivity of the test is 0.95, and
- the prevalence of the disease is 0.001.

```{r}
specificity = 0.99
sensitivity = 0.95
prevalence = 0.001
probability = (specificity*prevalence) / (specificity*prevalence + (1-sensitivity)*(1-prevalence))
probability
```

Yes, it is only about 2%!
