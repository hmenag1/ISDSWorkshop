# Bayes' Rule

Suppose an individual tests positive for a disease, what is the probability the individual has the disease? 

This probability can be calculated using [Bayes' Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_rule):

\[ P(D|+) = \frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+|D)P(D)+P(+|\sim D)P(\sim D)} \]

where 

- $\sim D$ means the individual does not have the disease
- $P(+|D)$ is the [sensitivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) of the test
- $P(+|\sim D) = 1-P(-|\sim D)$
- $P(-|\sim D)$ is the [specificity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) of the test
- $P(D)$ is the [prevalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence) of the disease
- $P(\sim D) = 1-P(D)$ 

Calculate the probability the individual has the disease if the test positive when

- the specificity of the test is 0.99, 
- the sensistivity of the test is 0.95, and
- the prevalence of the disease is 0.001.

```{r}
specificity = 0.99
sensitivity = 0.95
prevalence = 0.001
probability = (specificity*prevalence) / (specificity*prevalence + (1-sensitivity)*(1-prevalence))
probability
```

Yes, it is only about 2%!
