# Introduction to R activity

Cut-and-paste the following commands into a **new script** and then run those commands directly from the script using `Ctrl-R` (PC) or `Command-Enter` (Mac).

```{r}
x = 1:10
y = rep(c(1,2), each=5)
m = lm(y~x)
s = summary(m)
s$r.squared
```

Now, look at the result of each line

```{r}
x
y
m
s
```

For those who are familiar with linear regression, this may look familiar. [Back to slide.](../intro.html)
